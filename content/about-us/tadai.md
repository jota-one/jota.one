*Tada√Ø* is an artist, on the widest scope you could define this word.
He excels in all kinds of computing layers from app modeling to infrastructure
management, he has 10 ideas per day and could technically realize each of them
if days were lasting 400h.

He has also extensive design and UX skills, which is the hell of a gift for
a programmer üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

*You can ask him for:*
- Basically the same things as [Jori√±ho](@/about-us/jorinho.md) + the following
(so be kind and also ask sometimes to Jori√±ho)
- Graphic design (web UI, mobile UI, any UI in fact)
- Frontend optimization (memory consumption, package size optimization, etc.)
- Infrastructure (Linux configuration, server setup, infrastructure as code, etc.)
