<!--### The simplest possible way to hear my music
> It's been years I tried to have my sister hearing my mixes on iTunes but
> she never really figured out how to subscribe to my podcast.
>
> Thanks to the streaming services trend and the huge improvements of the web
> APIs it made full sense to me to build a web application where people could
> listen to my mixes in 2 clicks: the link to my podcast webapp and then the
> "play" button.

### &nbsp;
> It was also the opportunity to automate the publishing of the podcast during
> the build of the app instead of editing the XML manually or with a dedicated
> desktop application.
