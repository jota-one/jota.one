### Projects
<!-- Be Zulu -->

Podcast is a great technology, especially as an iTunes user...

When you're a DJ and need to promote your mixes, having a podcast is very
helpful but some crucial aspects of your communication are not met:

- visual impact
- no software dependency
- direct (one click) access to music

We tried to address those issues for the **Be Zulu!** crew, hope you enjoy the sound ðŸŽ§

**Ferenc Farkas** was a famous hungarian classical music composer.

His family
did a wonderful job documenting his work (more than 800 pieces) with pictures,
author cd's and a complete catalogue of works.

Our contribution in promoting Farkas's work was to make a website that best
enhances the incredible work made over the years by his family.

And thanks to the **[Jamstack](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/)** we
lowered the hosting costs to a minimum: **zero** ðŸ¤“
