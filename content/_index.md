### Projects
<!-- Be Zulu -->

Podcast is a great technology, especially as an iTunes user...

When you're a DJ and need to promote your mixes, having a podcast is very
helpful but some crucial aspects of your communication are not met:

- visual impact
- no software dependency
- direct (one click) access to music

We tried to address those issues for the **Be Zulu!** crew, hope you enjoy the sound ðŸŽ§

**Ferenc Farkas** was a famous hungarian classical music composer.

His family
did a wonderful job documenting his work (more than 800 pieces) with pictures,
author cd's and a complete catalogue of works.

Our contribution in promoting Farkas's work was to make a website that best
enhances the incredible work made over the years by his family.

And thanks to the **[Jamstack](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/)** we
lowered the hosting costs to a minimum: **zero** ðŸ¤“

### About

#### Who we are

We are 2 experienced fullstack developers based in Switzerland and have been
in the game for the last 20 years. We currently work as senior consultants.

**Jota** is a side project we started in 2019 and work on during our free time.
We give our hearts at it and take all the time needed to build meaningful,
performant and easy-to-use softwares.

Our goal is to sell our enterprise-grade software(s) and release open-source
projects for the community. We plan to start selling in 2021.

#### Why we do this

We are passionate developers and have great fun building our products.
We also feel indebted to the open-source community for all the great softwares
we use freely in our daily work and want to give back.

We also want to experience running a business of our own, be it aside of our
main job, as a collaboration with our current employers or fully
indenpendantly.

#### For the win
We started Jota because we deeply enjoy conceiving, designing and implementing
products we truly believe in. It has made us better developers and better
consultants in addition to build up new skills every day; and that feels
very enhancing.

So even if we fail at doing our business, we'll continue acting like we did for
the last 2 years ðŸ’ª
